= Bandcamp, etc. (`bandcampetc`)
:toc:
:toclevels: 0

Scripts to keep music tidy. The main one extracts and cleans files from https://bandcamp.com/[Bandcamp] and Amazon Music downloads. It should work with pretty much any ZIP archive that contains MP3 or FLAC files, actually. <<sample-exec,See example below.>>


== Getting started

=== Execution

1. Download the project and save it where it suits you.

2. Add the `bin/` directory to your `PATH` to be able to run these scripts from anywhere.

.`~/.bashrc`
[source, bash]
--
PATH+=':~/bin/bandcampetc/bin/'
export PATH
--

WARNING: Make sure you adapt the `~/bin/bandcampetc/bin/` path of the example according to where you saved this project.


=== Dependencies

The `bandcamp` script relies on:

[horizontal]
Bash version ≥ 4::  Because associative arrays. Should already be OK except maybe on old Macs.

`eyeD3`::       Manipulate MP3 metadata. Note that the software’s package is generally called `eyed3`.
                These guys often break backward compatibility… I adapted my commands at least to versions `0.6.18` (Ubuntu 16) and `0.7.10` (Debian 9). <<contact-section,Tell me>> if you get “unrecognized arguments” errors.

`metaflac`::    Manipulate FLAC metadata. Bundled with the `flac` package.

`rsync`::       “A fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool.”

`unzip`::       Decompress ZIP archives.

ImageMagick::   To manipulate cover art. (`imagemagick` package.)

`awk`::         “Pattern scanning and processing language.” GNU’s `gawk` implementation recommended, but the minimal implementation `mawk` does the job.

`geany`::       … as a recommended simple text editor to revise music metadata. You can use <<config-editor,any other editor by changing a constant’s value>> in `config/bandcamp.sh`.

`ffmpeg` or `avconv`::  For FLAC → MP3 conversions. *(Optional, see <<convert-config,the config section>>.)*

`file`::        Installed on most distributions, but missing from some Docker images.
                The package is also called `file`.

On Ubuntu and Debian machines, this should be enough to get everything:

[source, bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install eyed3 flac rsync unzip imagemagick gawk geany ffmpeg file
----


== Contents

=== `bandcamp`

The main script, at least from my point of view. When you download music from Bandcamp, Amazon Music, etc., you generally end up with a random ZIP archive full of poorly named files. Furthermore, the music’s metadata is often dirty as well: some labels add random information (sometimes even catalogue numbers!) in the tracks’ titles and so on.

This script can be run from anywhere (it has no importance) without argument.

1. It will look for ZIPs in `~/Downloads/`, `~/Téléchargements/`, `~/Descargas/`, `~/Загрузки/`… You can also give ZIPs directly as arguments to the script.
2. For each ZIP that contains MP3 or FLAC files, the files will be extracted.
3. You will be offered the possibility to edit the music’s metadata in a text editor.
4. The files will be tagged and named according to the cleaned version of the metadata.
5. If the album is in FLAC format and if the `CONVERT_TO_MP3` constant has been set to a non empty value, an MP3 version of the record will be generated alongside the FLAC version.
6. The original ZIP will be discarded.

See `bandcamp -h` for help.


=== `capitasong`

Try to put capital letters in nice places in song and record titles.
This is not perfect, of course, but this script provides a good starting point for metadata cleaning.
As time went by, this also became a utility to clean up some common ugly things that have little or even nothing to do with capitalization.

[source, bash]
----
  $ capitasong "You will blow up a dog some day, as the other guy said"
You Will Blow Up a Dog Some Day, as the Other Guy Said

  $ capitasong "Le chien de ta mère est gros"
Le Chien de Ta Mère Est Gros
----

[NOTE]
====
Many conventions exist.
I used stuff from http://aitech.ac.jp/~ckelly/midi/help/caps.html. (That weird link might become dead or point to something unrelated someday. Use with caution.)
====


=== `covers`

Try to fetch cover arts from various sources.
An old ugly script of mine.
Don’t pay it too much attention.
Most album downloads already contain a cover anyway, so this is seldom called.
This may break as the used websites change their APIs or page layout, etc.

[WARNING]
====
Since Bandcamp albums always contain a cover art already, I don’t devote time to the `covers` script.
It can still fetch stuff from Wikipedia (which can lead to some surprises, for better or for worse), but that’s about it.
See also https://github.com/alice-mm/bandcampetc/issues/41[].

I encourage you to manually add a `cover.jpg` file to ZIPs that come from somewhere else than Bandcamp, so that the main script will grab that and call it a day.
====


=== `setcover`

I like to add the cover art in the music files’ metadata. This way, even devices such as cars with no Internet access or whatever are able to display cover arts when playing music. The `setcover` script embed a cover art in MP3 and FLAC files. See `setcover -h` for help.


=== `create-lq-cover`

To prevent art addition (see `setcover`) from making my files oversized, I use a low-quality version of it. The `create-lq-cover` script simply creates lightweight pictures from a given original version.


=== `mmeta`

Used to be able to display metadata from MP3 and FLAC files using the same command. This uses homemade pattern strings.

[source, bash]
----
  $ mmeta '\n%f\n%a, “%t” [%l, %s]\n\t(“%A”, %y, %g)\n\n' ./{salvation,eternal_kingdom/*}/1*

./salvation/1_-_echoes.mp3
Cult of Luna, “Echoes” [59:09, 13.50 MB]
<TAB>(“Salvation”, 2004, Post-Metal)


./eternal_kingdom/flac/10_-_following_betulas.flac
Cult of Luna, “Following Betulas” [Unknown, Unknown]
<TAB>(“Eternal Kingdom”, 2008, Post-metal)
----

See `mmeta -h` for help.


=== `to_acceptable_name`

I _love_ this one. It eats a string and gives a version of it devoid of weird characters. I use it to rename all my music files. Since I buy obscure black metal and stuff, I had to update it to roughly transliterate Cyrillic and Icelandic. It still can’t handle Japanese properly, though. Sorry.

[source, bash]
----
    $ to_acceptable_name <<< "@Œӂ (%s/) «¼___.flac"
atoez_s_1_4.flac

    $ to_acceptable_name <<< '円423 for you.MP3'
423_yens_for_you.mp3
----

[TIP]
====
This script also cuts https://elaltardelholocausto.bandcamp.com/album/i-t[long file names] to 255{nbsp}characters to avoid errors, while trying to keep the file’s extension.
====


=== `give_acceptable_name`

Use `to_acceptable_name` to find a suitable name for a file, and rename that file using that name.

[TIP]
====
I like to add this as a custom action in my file manager. Typically, in Thunar:

----
give_acceptable_name %F
----

(“Edit” → “Configure custom actions…”)

Remember to check that the “Appearance Conditions” are broad enough.
====


== Configuration of the `bandcamp` script

Various settings can be changed in the `config/bandcamp.sh` file.

[#convert-config]
=== Converting FLAC files to MP3s

To get both a FLAC and an MP3 version of your records, check the part of `config/bandcamp.sh` that looks like this:

[source, bash]
----
CONVERT_TO_MP3=''
----

To turn the feature on, change this line to:

[source, bash]
----
CONVERT_TO_MP3=1
----

[TIP]
====
To activate conversion for one specific run, you can use the `-c` option:

[source, bash]
----
$ bandcamp -c
----
====


[#config-editor]
=== Editor

To choose the text editor used to edit music metadata, check the part of `config/bandcamp.sh` that looks like this:

[source, bash]
----
unset -v EDITOR
#readonly EDITOR=(nano -S)
#readonly EDITOR=(vi)
#readonly EDITOR=(mousepad)
#readonly EDITOR=(leafpad)
#readonly EDITOR=(gedit)
readonly EDITOR=(geany -i)
----

The commented out lines give you examples for other editors than Geany. Uncomment one of them (while commenting the others), or write your own assignment.

[NOTE]
====
I use an indexed array rather than a dumb string to make the script more robust: you can use parameters that contain spaces: `readonly EDITOR=(foo -f 'bar plop' -M)`
====

[TIP]
====
To make the script run without any interaction, use a no-op or any idle-ish command as an editor: `readonly EDITOR=(:)`
====


== Tests

=== Unit tests

I love trying to do unit testing in Bash. Just run `./run_tests.sh` and a bunch of commands will be executed. The first failure stops the execution (`set -e`) and you should be able to see what failed in the output.

If everything works as intended, the output should end with a message like:

----
run_tests.sh: All done (22 files).
----

[TIP]
====
For development purposes, you can run a subset of the test scripts by passing them as arguments:

[source, bash]
----
$ ./run_tests.sh test_scripts/mmeta.sh test_scripts/setcover/gettype.sh
----
====


=== Integration tests

The `run_integration_tests.sh` script runs the unit tests as well as the `bandcamp` script in a Debian Docker container. Nothing fancy for now as I’m no Docker expert, but it allowed me to improve stuff already.
